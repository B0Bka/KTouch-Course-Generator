Script to generate a programmer-friendly lecture for Ktouch
(http://ktouch.sourceforge.net/).

This only uses random characters and alternates levels with new characters and
review levels.
New characters are progressively introduced by finger and later on include
punctuation, capital letters and (optional) accented letters.

It tends to be pretty hard and unnerving - I take no responsibility for smashed 
keyboards or any kind of repetitive strain injury.
