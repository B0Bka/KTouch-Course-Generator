Script to generate a programmer-friendly course for KTouch 2.3.0,
the KDE Typing Trainer (https://edu.kde.org/applications/all/ktouch).

Original introduction by UncleZeiv for his KTouch Lecture Generator:

"This only uses random characters and alternates levels with new characters
and review levels. New characters are progressively introduced by finger and
later on include punctuation, capital letters and (optional) accented letters.

"It tends to be pretty hard and unnerving - I take no responsibility for
smashed keyboards or any kind of repetitive strain injury."

My Changes:

UncleZeiv's code was for a previous version of KTouch that required a
different XML format for imports.  This fork is for KTouch 2.3.0.

I flattened and shortened the Python script by removing the class structure,
to make it easier for me to understand and modify (sorry).

How to Use:

I've only tested the Python script on Ubuntu 14.04, but it should run
as-is on most platforms. (I also assume you'll want to customise the list
of new characters in the script, i.e. the "chargroups" list).

* When you've generated your XML file, start Ktouch 2.3.0.
* Create a profile.
* Tools (the wrench, top right) -> Course and Keyboard Layout Editor
* Import Button -> browse to the XML file and select it
* Keyboard Layout dropdown-menu -> Select language of current profile
* The custom course should now appear in the main Ktouch window,
  but if it does not, try the left/right green arrows.
  
License:

I don't see any license declaration for the original script on UncleZeiv's
project, so the license is presumably as per the GitHub Terms & Conditions:

"By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow
others to view and fork your repositories."
